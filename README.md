One of my homeworks at university. 
The main idea is to create one module of an application similar to Airbnb for renting accommodation, with certain privileges for each user:
- To add new accommodations that can be rented
- To delete accommodations that are no longer in good condition and will not be rented
- To modify a specific accommodation record
- To mark certain accommodation as rented.

  
Then a React application should be the one making the appropriate requests to my API. I've also used pagination and Hooks in the React js.
